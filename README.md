# PAA3905
Arduino library for the
[PAA3905 optical flow camera](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/paa3905-optical-flow-camera/)

This code is based on Kris Winer's PAA3905 [sketches](https://github.com/kriswiner/PAA3905).  As usual, I took
Kris's code an made an Arduino library that you can clone into your Arduino/libraries folder to
run examples and use for other projects.
